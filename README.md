AI Image Generation App (Gemini API)
Developed an AI-powered image generation application using Gemini API. Implemented a full-stack setup where the backend handles API integration and the frontend (live server) provides a user-friendly interface for generating images from text prompts. Gained hands-on experience with API integration, backend-frontend communication, and AI-driven image generation.
